Telescope Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the documentation for `Telescope <https://github.com/jhigginbotham64/Telescope>`_, a game engine
that abstracts rendering and physics into an easy-to-use yet powerful toolset.

Telescope was created `Joshua Higginbotham <https://github.com/jhigginbotham64>`_ & `Clem Cords <https://github.com/clemapfel>`_.

If you are looking for instructions on how to install
telescope, please instead visit the `GitHub page <https://github.com/jhigginbotham64/Telescope#installation>`_.
